# Python Project Management Tools

## Description

Tried different Python project management tools like Poetry, Huak, and Rye.

I found `huak` the best out of all. As it has the same commands as `cargo` in Rust, it is easy to remember and use. There is another tool called [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (by team behind `ruff` - Astral) that I am keeping an eye on. It's still in development. Doesn't seem exactly like a copy of cargo, but it's a good tool to keep an eye on.
