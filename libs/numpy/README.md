# Numpy
## Features
* Faster than lists as it is fixed type, requires less bytes of memory (contiguous).
* Mathematics Replacement for Matlab
* Does plotting
* backend for Plotting, Connect 4, Digital Photography
* Machine Learning (Tensorflow built similar to numpy)

## Learn
* [Refer the notebook](./numpy.ipynb)

## Concepts
* Normal Distribution (like Gaussian Distribution) has 3 main params:
	- __loc__ i.e. mean, where the peak of the bell exists or the centre of the distribution
	- __scale__ i.e. Standard Deviation, how much flat the curve is, or spread or “width” of the distribution. Must be non-negative.
	- __size__ i.e. shape of the returned array
