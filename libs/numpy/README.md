# Numpy
## Features
* Faster than lists as it is fixed type, requires less bytes of memory (contiguous).
* Mathematics Replacement for Matlab
* Does plotting
* backend for Plotting, Connect 4, Digital Photography
* Machine Learning (Tensorflow built similar to numpy)


## Coding
* multiplication
```py
# in case of list
a = [1, 3, 4]
b = [4, 6, 8]
a*b = ERROR

# in case of numpy
a = np.array(1, 3, 4)
b = np.array(4, 6, 8)
a*b = np.array([4. 18. 32])
```
